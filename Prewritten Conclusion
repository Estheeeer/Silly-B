In the 21st century, the world is becoming more and more crowded and populated. Soon enough we won’t have much space as we used to. Hence, the focus of contemporary technology study has been shifted to bring all our devices to a smaller scale and eventually to the nanometer level. Many scientists believe nanoelectronics is the key to that goal. After decades of study we’ve already made some progress in the field but there is still much more to discover. We've developed several approaches and applied them in their corresponding field. However, this technology is still in the process of development, and it requires the attention of future scientists and engineers such as us.
